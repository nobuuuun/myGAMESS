   QMCPACK-GAMESS interface for QMC-EFMO method based on Python/Fireworks scritps 
together with an llustrative example on a cluster of 16 water molecules (on Edison/NERSC).

   Steps of the QMC-EFMO process:

1) ./qmc_efmo_pre.py wat16_EFMO.dat

(A pre-processing step that parses a GAMESS EFMO "dat" output file and produces fragment
information that is needed for the actual QMC-EFMO run.)

2a) ./qmc_efmo_mon.py

2b) ./qmc_efmo_dim.py

(The actual QMC-EFMO run that consists of GAMESS and QMCPACK runs on monomers and dimers.)

3) ./qmc_efmo_post.py wat16_EFMO.out

(A post-processing step that assembles the energy outputs from GAMESS and QMCPACK into
the final QMC-EFMO energy and error.)

   The file structure:

* main directory: README file, the driver scripts qmc_efmo_pre.py, qmc_efmo_mon.py, qmc_efmo_dim.py and 
qmc_efmo_post.py; GAMESS input/output file of the 16 water-cluster example: wat16_EFMO.inp, 
wat16_EFMO.out, and wat16_EFMO.dat.

* scripts (subdirectory): a library of Python scripts

* fireworks (subdirectory): files related to Fireworks

* templ_files (subdirectory): template files
