#                       NODE= physical enclosure (box/blade)
#
#       1. User provided a host list as a file. The host list should have this
#          structure (one node per line, two entrees per line: node name
#          and the number of cores):
#          node1 8
#          node2 12

   endif
#
#       3. This is an example of how to run on a multi-core SMP enclosure,
#          where all CPUs (aka COREs) are inside a -single- NODE.
#     At other locations, you may wish to consider some of the examples
#     that follow below, after commenting out this ISU specific part.

#
#       4. How to run in a single computer, namely the "localhost", so
#          this computer needn't have a proper Internet name.
#          This example also presumes SysV was deliberately *not* chosen
#          when DDI was compiled, so that host names have to be repeated,
#          instead of using the simpler localhost:cpus=$NCPU form.
#
#          This example is appropriate for use with the pre-compiled
#          Apple binary from our web site, provided it is uncommented,
#          and the passage #2 just above is deleted or commented out.
#
#       5. A phony example, of four dual processors (arbitrary names)
#          Since their names never change, we just can just specify them.
#          Note that we can use a short name like 'bb' if and only if
#          system name resolution can map them onto the true host names.
#
#       6. An example of 16 uniprocessor boxes in a Beowulf-type cluster.
#          Because they are uniprocessors, we just set NNODES = NCPUS.
#          Their host names fall into the pattern fly1 to fly16,
#          which we can turn into a HOSTLIST with a small loop.

#        we have now finished setting up a correct HOSTLIST.

#                     - a typical MPI example -
#
#         This section is customized to two possible MPI libraries:
#             Intel MPI
#
#         See ~/gamess/tools/gms, which is a front-end script to submit
#         this file 'rungms' as a back-end script, to either scheduler.
#
#                   if you are using some other MPI:
#         See ~/gamess/ddi/readme.ddi for information about launching
#         processes using other MPI libraries (each may be different).
#         Again: we do not know how to run openMPI effectively.
#
#                   if you are using some other batch scheduler:
#         Illustrating other batch scheduler's way's of providing the
#         hostname list is considered beyond the scope of this script.
#         Suffice it to say that
#             a) you will be given hostnames at run time
#             b) a typical way is a disk file, named by an environment
#                variable, containing the names in some format.
#             c) another typical way is an blank separated list in some
#                environment variable.
#         Either way, whatever the batch scheduler gives you must be
#         sliced-and-diced into the format required by your MPI kickoff.
