!   (S)-Arsenicin A...vibrational analysis of the RHF/6-31G* structure
!   Point group is C2, 6-31G(d) has 242 basis functions, 90 occupied MOs.
!
!   This molecule is isolated in trace amounts from a New Caledonian sponge.
!   It is the first natural product found with more than one As atom, and its
!   a beaut.  Note the similarity to inorganic As4O6.  From ANU in Canberra.

!                   Organometallics 29, 32-33(2010)
!
!   The natural product is (S)-arsenicin A.  Here is how to make it:
!   Take adamantine skeleton, substitute 4 As's and 3 O's in the C10 cage.
!   The symmetry axis passes through a C and O in this structure, which
!   has two As that that are bonded to 2O,C, and two As bonded to 2C,O.
!   The two possible stereoisomers depend on how these As atoms are
!   arranged, with both being identical in energy.
!
!   FINAL E= -9277.3606409942, 12 iters, RMS grad= 0.000001776
!
!   This run took 85 seconds on a 2.66 GHz Cloverton (17 Mar 2015)
!   results have not changed substantially since 2009.

Only after doing separate geometry optimizations, and then the
principal axis transformaion, and keeping as unique all atoms 
with +y coordinates in (S), and with -x in (R), it is clear how 
to stereomutate (S) into (R).
Change the sign of x and z but not y, then exchange x and y.

The following is the C2 geometry of (S)-arsenicin:
