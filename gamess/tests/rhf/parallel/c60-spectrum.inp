!  C60, run in highest subgroup of Ih that GAMESS can use: Th
!  180 occupied MOs (60 are cores) and 120 Valence Virtual Orbitals
!
!  for the MINI basis set,
!     F.NAL E= -2256.1586979707, 9 iters, t1u LUMO is +0.0012 (e1u+a2u)

!  The former has references to experimental and Huckel spectra:
!  there is thought to be a dark T1u as LUMO and then an allowed
!  T2u as LUMO+1, at least in the early '90s literature.
!  But VVOs and an ordinary MINI calculation both place T1g and Hg
!  levels (both obviously dark) between these two.
!
!  * ACCT has 3300 AOs, drops 540 contaminants, and 106 more at
!  the slightly raised Qmatrix TOL=5d-6, for total of 2654 MOs.
!  The smallest eigenvalue of S for ACCT is 1D-10!
!     F.NAL E= -2272.4475041384 for ACCT
!  Can get convergence from extended Huckel guess with RSTRCT
!  turned on, but RDMINI of all orbitals from a GBASIS=MINI job
!  is quicker, and the ACCT SCF without any orbital restriction
!  can be counted on to sort orbitals by eigenvalue.
!  A little extra precision with the integrals doesn't hurt.
!  The MINI calculation is so quick, its orbs aren't stored here.
!  *  CCT has 2100 AOs, drops 300 contaminants, but no linear
!  dependencies at default Qmatrix TOL, thus keeping 1800 AOs.
!     F.NAL E= -2272.4332570912 for  CCT
!  Convergence from extended Huckel is a piece of cake.
!  * MINI is just 300 AOs, for the ACCT D5d geometry,
!     F.NAL E= -2256.1586979707, 9 iters, 78 s.conds on 1 Cloverton core
!
!  Orbital symmetry assignments in Ih are easily gleaned from the
!  labels in D5d, using Altmann and Herzig's subduction table 75.9:
!  Ax=A1x, T1x=A2x+E1x, T2x=A2x+E2x, Gx=E1x+E2x, Hx=A1x+E1x+E2x (x=g/u),
!  writing Gx rather than their Fx as name of the 4-fold degen. irrep.

!  Ih (and Th) have two-fold operations along the x,y,z directions,

!  It is not so very easy to extract a D5d geometry from Th, so the
