!   RVS method paper...water dimer interaction energy.
!   W.J.Stevens, W.H.Fink   Chem.Phys.Lett. 139, 15-22(1987)
!
!   this geometry is not what is quoted in the paper, rOO=2.991 vs. 3.0085,
!   because the paper optimized only to OPTTOL=5d-4 (not very tight).
!   Energies found at the tightly optimized dimer geometry, but with
!   the monomers kept at the paper's constraints, are:
!     F_NAL RHF ENERGY IS      -76.0464785458 AFTER  13 ITERATIONS  m

!   m is quoted monomer energy in table 2.    
!   x is the energy optimized under the $STATPT's (paper's) constraints.
!   x-2m = -5.12, in agreement with Kitaura/Morokuma's printout.
