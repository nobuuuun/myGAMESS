!   This computation is on the triplet state of a biradical,
!   H2Si2O2, using the geometry of the singlet biradical.
!   The 6-31G(d) problem size is small, just 72 AOs and 72 MOs, of which
!   core=12, valence=12 alpha and 10 beta, virtual=48 alpha and 50 beta.

!   Molecule is from
!      M.W.Schmidt, K.A.Nguyen, M.S.Gordon, J.A.Montgomery,
!      J.Am.Chem.Soc.  113, 5998-6001(1991).
!   This example was used in Table 11 of
!      M.Wloch, J.R.Gour, P.Piecuch
!      J.Phys.Chem.A 111, 11359-82(2007)
!   to illustrate CCSD is orbital invariant, unless some orbitals
!   are removed from the calculation as "frozen cores", but that
!   CR-CCL's triples do indeed depend on the canonicalization.
!
!   The geometry in this test is the TCSCF singlet ground state,
!   which is a near perfect biradical, C1= 0.708575, C2= -0.705635
!   singlet= -728.7681499744 at its optimal geometry, so triplet's
!   FINAL E= -728.7692583095 would be a bit more lower if optimized.
!
!   the correlated energy results are
!     CCSD                       E=     -729.2805759018
!     CR-CC(2,3),A OR CCSD(2)_T  E=     -729.2934500445
!     CR-CC(2,3) OR CR-CCSD(T)_L E=     -729.2954146313
!   and these are the results you will see from the standard input file.
!
!   Total run time is 183 seconds on 2.66 GHz Cloverton ( 3 Apr 2015)
!   results have not changed since May 2007
!   --------------------------------------------------------------------
!   Still using 12 frozen cores, but changing to Guest/Saunders'
!   canonicalization changes the results very slightly, to
!     CCSD                       E=     -729.2805698440
!     CR-CC(2,3) OR CR-CCSD(T)_L E=     -729.2954258828
!   because we freeze off 12 slightly different orbitals.
!
!   Using no frozen cores, and two different canonicalizations,
!   does give invariant results for the CCSD, but not triples,
!     CCSD                       E=     -729.3073278874  (Roothaan)
!     CCSD                       E=     -729.3073278878  (Guest/Saunders)
!     CR-CC(2,3) OR CR-CCSD(T)_L E=     -729.3227325741  (Roothaan)
!     CR-CC(2,3) OR CR-CCSD(T)_L E=     -729.3227502622  (Guest/Saunders)
!   The amplitudes are different, of course, for different orbitals.
