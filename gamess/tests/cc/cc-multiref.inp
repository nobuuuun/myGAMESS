!   test for robustness of CC methods on a multireference molecule,
!   collected from Aaron in February 2012.
!
!   ROHF with Na=Nb is the same as RHF, but executes through
!   different codes, causing it to find different results below.
!   See 'cc-compare' for a single reference case, where these
!   two programs agree perfectly.
!
!   RHF and ROHF both have FINAL energy=     -152.6951541172.
!    RHF-based right-CCSD starts at E(corr)=   -0.4391399016,
!                         using MP2 doubles amplitudes as its guess,
!                         converged E(CCSD)= -153.1269835608.
!   ROHF-based right-CCSD starts at E(corr)=   -0.4353625553
!                         using an unknown initial guess,
!                         converged E(CCSD)= -153.1941150500.
!    This run is chosen to be ROHF, and getw -153.1941149870
!
!   We request CR-CCL below to be sure the ROHF runs the left-CCSD.
!   The triples corrections of course diff, and aren't recorded here.
!
!   iterations are numerous,
!    RHF-based code: right CCSD= 105 iters, left-CCSD= 249 iters,
!   ROHF-based code: right CCSD=  97 iters, left-CCSD= 456 iters.
!
!   orbital 12 is the HOMO, orbital 13 the LUMO of this closed shell.
!
!   For the RHF-based implementation, the right-CCSD has two large T1's,
!        T1 AMPLITUDE IS -0.460944 FOR I=  12 -> A=  13
!        T1 AMPLITUDE IS  0.109722 FOR I=   9 -> A=  13
!   and its left-CCSD greatly reduces these, (print bug! there's 3 cores)
!        LA1=  -0.2428659409 FOR   I -> A   =    9   10
!        LA1=   0.0657633055 FOR   I -> A   =    6   10
!   The RHF program can do a density matrix, and prints the fairly
!   benign looking 17.67 e- in principal and 0.33 in secndary NOs.
!
!   For the ROHF-based implementation, the right-CCSD has
!        T1=   0.8268849275 FOR IA -> AA =  12  13
!        T1=   0.8268849212 FOR IB -> AB =  12  13
!        T2=  -0.7456463842 FOR IA,JB -> AA, BB =  12  12  13  13
!   and its left-CCSD again greatly reduces these amplitudes,
!        LA1=   0.1364476918 FOR IA -> AA =  12  13
!        LA1=   0.1364469203 FOR IB -> AB =  12  13
!        LA2=  -0.1410144061 FOR IA,JB -> AA, BB =  12  12  13  13
!
!   These large amplitudes teach us not to trust CC for MR problems.
!   MWS does not understand why the large amplitudes are much smaller
!   in the left CCSD solutions.
!
!   this run takes 73/309 seconds for RHF/ROHF on 2.66 GHz Clov (18 Jul 2016)
