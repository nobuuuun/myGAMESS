!      water dipole by numerical differentiation wrt applied electric field.
!      test case created in June 2014 (for testing ACPF/AQCC density mtx).
!
!      This is a way to test a new "expectation value density matrix".
!      Here we run RHF, for which we are certain the density is correct,
!      just to show how to do this for something else.
!
!      Run this job three times, to obtain these energies
!           positive field: FINAL RHF E= -76.0426204259
!         no applied field: F.NAL RHF E= -76.0418435627
!           negative field: F.NAL RHF E= -76.0410745552
!      The middle run prints analytic dipole from RHF density = 1.964622
!
!      central differencing (we do it by hand!) gives numerical dipole as
!             mu-z = (E(ez) - E(-ez))/(2*ez)
!      0.0015458707/0.002 = 0.772935 a.u. * 2.54176 = 1.964616 Debye.
!
!      Note that numerical differentiation should not be pushed to
!      very tiny step sizes.  We need some significant figures in
!      the numerator!  GAMESS energies can typically be trusted to
!      the 8th absolute decimal place, so here the energy difference
!      contains about 6 significant figures, because of the 0.001 field
!      magnitude choice.  So, we get about 5 figures in the dipole.
!
!      The step size is easy to test, as other choices near the same
!      value should be numerically similar derivatives.  You can also
!      compare forward and reverse differences to the more accurate
!      central difference,
!             mu-z = (E(ez) - E(0))  /ez
!             mu-z = (E(0)  - E(-ez))/ez
!      to get a feel for the 'noise' in the numerical differentiation.
!
!      this run takes 0 seconds on 2.66 GHz Cloverton (15 Apr 2015)
