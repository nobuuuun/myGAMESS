!  F atom, 6-311G(d) orbital exponent optimization test.
!  Both MCSCF and CI are run in the same job stream, to test
!  their coexistence.
!
!  The d exponent is optimized, using a wavefunction that
!  preserves both space and spin symmetry for the open shell
!  atom.  The optimization is on a variational energy, the
!  singles and doubles CI function.  The result is a final
!  CI energy of -99.5662491856, with zeta(d)=1.633187.
!
!  It is interesting to compare this value to the 6-311G(d)
!  value obtained by Pople for F, using UHF (spin and space
!  symmetry broken) + UMP2 (non-variational), zeta(d)=1.750.
!  You can easily convert this job to a UHF + UMP2 trudge,
!  and then you will learn Pople didn't use the frozen core
!  approximation.  A frozen core UMP2 exponent optimization
!  gives a value very close to the CISD value found here.

!   input to define the MCSCF orbital optimization.  Note that
!   the three 2-P states are averaged to preserve radial degeneracy.
!   This is really an open shell SCF computation, since there is
!   the same number of configurations as degenerate roots of the
