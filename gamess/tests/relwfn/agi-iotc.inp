!    AgI...infinite order two component scalar relativity...DFT force constants
!    This is to show that just about any WFN, including DFT,
!    can be given scalar relativity quite easily.
!
!    Note that one has to pay a bit of attention to the heavy atom's
!    radial grid, due to very large exponents in their basis set.
!
!    FINAL R-REVTPSS E= -12431.9521215284, 20 iters, FREQ=214.64
!
!    This run takes 928 seconds on 2.66 GHz Cloverton (10 Aug 2015)
