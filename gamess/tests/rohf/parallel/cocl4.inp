!  The RSTRCT=.T. is required, since this doubly negative ion
!  has a open shell f-u level as its HOMO, with positive energy,
!  namely eps(t2)= +0.1502 with default canonicalization.
!  SOSCF does not handle this molecule gracefully.
!
!  This run takes 1 second on almost anything (31 Mar 2015)
!  results have not changed substantially since at least 2005.
