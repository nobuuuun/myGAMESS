!   tough UHF case from Galya
!   This has a somewhat stretched HC bond, and the lowest energy
!   solution is more spin-contaminated due to partial triplet
!   instability in that bond pair.  If DIIS stays on throughout,
!   it doesn't converge, but this shows that switching DIIS off
!   for a while is great, as it converges correctly:
!
!   DIIS finds FINAL E= -113.2418193786, 61 iters, <S**2>= 1.266
!   DIIS switches itself off and on 5 times during this run!
!   SOSCF will find     -113.2418193785 in just 30 iterations,
!   but reports a huge angle rescaled at iteration 10.
!
!   This job takes 1 second on a 1.5 GHz Power4+ (3 Nov 2009)
