!    triplet Au2O4, a tricky UHF convergence problem from Sergej
!    The ECP basis set used here has 172 AOs, 156 MOs,
!    with 36 alpha and 34 beta occupied MOs (12 core)
!
!    The UHF ground state is 3-Bu, with valence electron configuration
!         alpha=  8ag+4au+4bg+8bu  beta=8ag+3au+3bg+8bu
!    Starting from a Huckel guess reordered to the known electron config,
!       soscf: FINAL UHF E= -569.4516250406, 26 iters, <S**2>= 2.953
!        diis: FINAL UHF E= -569.4332295481, 35 iters, <S**2>= 2.651
!    This higher energy DIIS result is the -same- configuration as the 
!    SOSCF, so it represents a case where DIIS (in spite of switching
!    itself off one time) does not converge to the true, more spin-
!    contaminated solution, started with precisely the same orbitals.
!
!    the SOSCF run takes 17 seconds on a Dell node (14 Jan 2009)
!
!         learning how to reorder the Huckel guess was painful:
!    results in 2009, with new U-SOSCF, using Huckel orbs, no ordering
!       diis: F_NAL UHF E=  -569.3988551988, 25 iters, <S**2>= 2.303, 3-Bu
!      soscf: F_NAL UHF E=  -569.2836665245, 49 iters, <S**2>= 3.059, 3-Bu
!    so neither one finds the lowest UHF solution seen in 2002! (see below)
!    The 2009 strategy for switching DIIS off/on does not result in DIIS 
!    ever being turned off, so the DIIS run is like pre-2002.  
!    Following 2002, we try DFT.  With Lebedev grid, B3LYP= -572.5647482713,
!    <S**2>=2.472 (Huckel, DIIS), so we don't see the lower E noted in 2002.
!    MOREAD of the -572.5647 B3LYP orbitals gives
!       diis: F_NAL UHF E=  -569.4116528855, 20 iters, <S**2>= 3.179
!      soscf: F_NAL UHF E=  -569.4116528855, 20 iters, <S**2>= 3.179, 3-Au
!    reordering beta HOMO and LUMO in this last run results in
!      soscf: F_NAL UHF E=  -569.4047044629, 20 iters, <S**2>= 3.078, 3-Bg
!    What is going on?  the four energis are 4 different electron configs:
!      -569.283 is alpha= 9ag+4au+3bg+8bu  beta=8ag+4au+3bg+7bu
!      -569.398 is alpha= 8ag+4au+4bg+8bu  beta=7ag+4au+4bg+7bu
!      -569.404 is alpha= 8ag+4au+4bg+8bu  beta=8ag+3au+4bg+7bu
!      -569.411 is alpha= 8ag+4au+4bg+8bu  beta=8ag+4au+3bg+7bu
!    Fooling around with mix=.true. nosym=1 on the B3LYP orbitals
!    recovers the -569.451 energy seen in 2002.  MOREAD of these
!    orbitals, with PURIFY=.TRUE. leads to learning this a 5th config,
!      -569.451 is alpha= 8ag+4au+4bg+8bu  beta=8ag+3au+3bg+8bu, 3-Bu
!    Clearly this is in part an electronic configuration problem, as
!    well as being somewhat a converger problem.  The 6th energy found
!    has the same configuration as the ground state, with less spin
!    contamination, so SOSCF beats out DIIS when both are given an
!    identical set of Huckel orbitals and the right occupancy.
!
!    results obtained in 2002:
!      UHF converges to -569.3988551402 in 25 iters with Huckel orbs and shift,
!         using the old code that does not turn DIIS off if E rises.
!      UHF converges to -569.4516249795 in 61 iters with Huckel orbs and shift,
!         this run is divergent if the level shifting is off.
!      UHF converges to -569.4516249796 in 23 iters from -572.595 B3LYP orbs
!    <S**2> of -569.398 is 2.303, <S**2> of -569.451 is 2.953
!
!    B3LYP converges to -572.5651656430 in 21 iters with MOREAD of higher UHF
!    B3LYP converges to -572.5950095368 in 25 iters with MOREAD of lower UHF
!    B3LYP converges to -572.5950095368 in 42 iters with Huckel orbs.
!    convergence of both MOREAD jobs is quite smooth, the latter relies on
!    DIIS switching off and some very bumpy extrapolation iterations.
!    <S**2> of -572.565 is 2.472, <S**2> of -575.595 is 2.083
!
!    In spite of the interesting switch in <S**2> values, this example
!    seems to be a convergence problem at the UHF level.  DFT tracks
!    UHF well, so one can use this to exercise ordinary UHF convergence.
