!  An example for RHF/6-31+G(d,p) water follows (29 AOs):
!
!    To test OpenMP parallelization: run this in serial and in parallel to spot
!    changes specific to OpenMP as opposed to general newly-introduced bugs
!    Compare the following output parameters:
!    optimized screening parameters - twice
!
!    The Stone analysis does not do numerical integration, so the
!    screening region should be smaller (e.g. VDWSCL 0.4 to 0.5)
!    Bond midpoints are included in the multipole screening.
!
!   SINGLE EXPONENTIAL USED AS DAMPING FUNCTION:
!     O=1.8552, H=2.3826, midpoints=10.0
!   SINGLE GAUSSIAN USED AS DAMPING FUNCTION:
!     O=1.3044, H=0.9481, midpoints=10.1969
!
!   This run takes 1 second on 2.66 GHz Cloverton ( 6 Oct 2015)
!   answers unchanged since September 2008
