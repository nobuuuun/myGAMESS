!   Jerry's V(N3)4 which is so cool it is even adopts S4 symmetry,
!   which is the symmetry of a baseball (considering its stitches).
!   the MCP run has 37 alpha and 36 beta MOs, 385 total MOs, 452 AOs.
!   test case collected June 2010.
!
!   This input exposed an error in parallel MCP gradients, now fixed.
!   It was kept because guess=Huckel finds an incorrect configuration,
!   but converges if one flips the Huckel HOMO and LUMO.  Note that
!   April 2013 Huckel changes made the iterations far more systematic,
!   from clean symmetry starting orbs, but did not remove the need
!   to reorder to place a B symmetry orbital at #37.

!   2-B state FINAL RO-B3LYP E= -191.2006418131, 34 iters, RMS= 0.031822576

!   this run took 1847 seconds 2.66 GHz Cloverton ( 7 Apr 2015)
!   answers have been stable since 2013.
