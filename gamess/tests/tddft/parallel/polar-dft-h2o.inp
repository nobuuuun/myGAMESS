!    DFT water's B(-2W;W,W) hyperpolarizability, through the TDDFT module.
!    This is not a very good example, should use something polarizable!
!    But this is the test as it come from Federico in 2014
!
!    The beta being tested is the one for 2nd harmonic generation.
!    The alpha tensors A(-W,W) and A(-2W,2W) are easy by-products.
!    Note that the TD-DFT run does not actually compute any excited states!
!
!    The standard test is beta for SHG using the PBE0 functional:
!       ALPHA(1,1)   =   12.4076
!       ALPHA(2,2)   =   10.8454
!       ALPHA(3,3)   =   10.9442  (these are for W3=0.2 a.u.)
!       BETA(3,1,1)  =   -2.4094
!       BETA(3,2,2)  =  -17.6900
!       BETA(1,1,3)  =  -21.9180
!       BETA(2,2,3)  =  -17.1723
!       BETA(3,3,3)  =  -16.9806
!
!    this test takes 587 seconds on 2.66 GHz Cloverton (20 Aug 2014)
!
!    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
!    If run without a functional, the calculation is TD-HF,
!    and then can be compared to that independent programming.
!    The TD-DFT module produces the 1st column, the TDHF module the 2nd.
!    ALPHA(w) for W=0.2 is:
!       ALPHA XX      =     9.1305      9.1305
!       ALPHA YY      =     9.7686      9.7685
!       ALPHA ZZ      =     9.2335      9.2336
!    For B(-2W;W,W), the 2nd harmonic generation:
!       BETA(3,1,1)   =    -0.2989     -0.2988
!       BETA(3,2,2)   =   -13.6278    -13.6279
!       BETA(1,1,3)   =    -4.9164     -4.9161
!       BETA(2,2,3)   =   -13.5096    -13.5097
!       BETA(3,3,3)   =   -10.1278    -10.1278
!    In separate runs, the TD-DFT program will generate two other
!    beta tensors, namely B(0;W,-W) for optical rectification:
!       BETA(3,1,1)   =    -2.3999     -2.3996
!       BETA(3,2,2)   =   -11.2689    -11.2690
!       BETA(1,1,3)   =    -1.4272     -1.4270
!       BETA(2,2,3)   =   -11.2750    -11.2751
!       BETA(3,3,3)   =    -7.8760     -7.8760
!    and B(-W;W,0), the electrooptic pockels effect:
!       BETA(3,1,1)   =    -1.4272     -1.4270
!       BETA(3,2,2)   =   -11.2750    -11.2751
!       BETA(1,1,3)   =    -2.3999     -2.3996
!       BETA(2,2,3)   =   -11.2689    -11.2690
!       BETA(3,3,3)   =    -7.8760     -7.8760

!      the next two compare HF level results from two independent programs
!      their numerical results are for Cartesian GTO calculations.
!              input which will compute one beta tensor, by TD-DFT
!              these generate beta for SHG, OR, and EOPE respectively:
--- $contrl tddft=pol dfttyp=none ispher=0 $end
--- $tddft  alpha=.true. beta=.true. pfreq(1)=0.1, 0.1 $end
---x$tddft  alpha=.true. beta=.true. pfreq(1)=0.1,-0.1 $end
---x$tddft  alpha=.true. beta=.true. pfreq(1)=0.1, 0.0 $end

!              input to generate all three beta tensors, by TD-HF
--- $contrl runtyp=tdhf ispher=0 $end
--- $tdhf   inib=2 inig=0 atol=1.0d-6 btol=1.0d-6 nfreq=2 freq(1)=0.0,0.1 $end

!       the following input is to be used for all runs...
 $contrl scftyp=rhf $end
 $system mwords=5 $end
 $guess  guess=huckel $end
 $scf    dirscf=.true. $end
!             Giving the basis in $DATA works around the trap
!             for non-spherical harmonics found in $BASIS input.
!             Needed because RUNTYP=TDHF can't use spherical harmonics.
