To use this test, pick one of the 6 input sets below, all of
which generate the same singlets, in some cases adding triplets.
The standard test case is meant to be the first set.

Note that runs 1, 2, and 4 can also choose a nuclear gradient
calculation, below the last input set.

And below that, are a lot of comparisons of dipoles and transition dipoles

!       a) The first electron distribution should be used, to omit the

!       ground state can cause numerical difficulties.
!       b) Since this molecule has two nearly degenerate states for

!    but not the ORMAS or the spin-orbit runs.

These are clearly all the same, apart from the Davidson solver's 
convergence thresholds.  Under Tamm/Dancoff, the X excitation
amplitudes are just the CI coefficients of a stationary state.

The normalization on full TD-DFT amplitudes is 
     1 = summation (X(i->a))**2 - (Y(a->i))**2     (note the minus sign)


B. transition probability data:

1.  The TD-HF calculation:
   STATE       ENERGY     EXCITATION  TRANSITION DIPOLE, A.U.  OSCILLATOR
   1  A   -152.752024R3038   4.096     0.0865  0.0937  0.0026    0.002

2.  The CIS program:
 TRANSITION FROM THE GROUND STATE TO EXCITED STATE  1
 STATE MULTIPLICITIES =   1  1
 STATE ENERGIES =       -152.9025456166     -152.7520243229
 EXCITATION ENERGY =  9.9038E+14 [1/SEC] =    33035.61 [1/CM] =      4.10 [EV]
                            X           Y           Z           NORM
 TRANSITION DIPOLE =    0.086484    0.093700    0.002599    0.127539 E*BOHR
 TRANSITION DIPOLE =    0.219823    0.238165    0.006607    0.324173 DEBYE
 OSCILLATOR STRENGTH =    0.001632
 EINSTEIN COEFFICIENTS: A=  1.1882E+06 1/SEC; B=  6.6015E+06 SEC/G

3. the ORMAS program does not do transition dipoles.
4. the GUGA  program does not do transition dipoles, directly.

5. the GUGA  program for RUNTYP=TRANSITN does do transition dipoles,
 CI STATE NUMBER=  1  2 STATE MULTIPLICITY=  1  1
 STATE ENERGIES         -152.9025456173     -152.7520243087
 TRANSITION ENERGY=  9.9038E+14 [1/SEC] =    33034.85 [1/CM] =        4.10 [EV]
 TRANSITION DIPOLE =   -0.219824   -0.238164   -0.006607    0.324173 DEBYE
 OSCILLATOR STRENGTH =    0.001632
 EINSTEIN COEFFICIENTS: A=  1.1881E+06 1/SEC; B=  6.6011E+06 SEC/G

6. the spin orbit run's results are Z= -0.006606, see below for more details


C. dipole moment of the excited state:

Since CIS is not a fully variational method (orbital's don't relax),
there are two different density matrices.  The relaxed density from
gradient theory is often thought to be better, in terms of matching
experiment.  Here they are fairly different, since CIS may not be
a very good wavefunction?  Full CI does obey the Hellmann-Feynmann
theorem, but CIS dipoles differ by 0.5 Debye units, and quite
a bit in direction of the vector.

1. For TD-HF run, there is only a relaxed density matrix computable
         DX          DY          DZ         /D/  (DEBYE)
    -1.837414    0.821945   -0.019048    2.012970

2. For CIS run, using the CISPRP keyword, the property section prints
               USING THE RESPONSE (OR RELAXED) DENSITY
         DX          DY          DZ         /D/  (DEBYE)
    -1.837459    0.821948   -0.019063    2.013013
instead of results USING THE EXPECTATION VALUE DENSITY.  
CIS always prints these anyway, higher up in the log file, as
 EXPECTATION VALUE DIPOLE MOMENT FOR EXCITED STATE  1
                            X           Y           Z           NORM
      STATE DIPOLE =   -1.229643    0.442726    0.783471    1.523764 DEBYE
Every state's dipole, and every pair of state's transition moments
are printed after the CIS iterations converge.

3. For ORMAS run, since we have no gradient program, we cannot
obtained a relaxed density:
               USING THE EXPECTATION VALUE DENSITY
         DX          DY          DZ         /D/  (DEBYE)
    -1.229643    0.442726    0.783471    1.523764

4. For GUGA run, as straight CIS
               USING THE EXPECTATION VALUE DENSITY
         DX          DY          DZ         /D/  (DEBYE)
    -1.229643    0.442726    0.783471    1.523764

5. For the GUGA run that can compute the transition dipole,
the printing is badly labeled,
 CI STATE NUMBER=  2  2 STATE MULTIPLICITY=  1  1
 STATE ENERGIES         -152.7520243087     -152.7520243087
 TRANSITION DIPOLE =   -1.229643    0.442726    0.783471    1.523764 DEBYE
but this is clearly the correct state specific dipole for 
the first excited state.  

6. the spin-orbit run prints this, for both OPERAT=HSO1 and HSO2:
 DIPOLE MOMENTS ARE IN E*BOHR UNITS. TO GET DEBYE, MULTIPLY BY 2.541766.
   < 1-1A |R| 1-1A > =     -1.121136      0.517556     -0.487263 [CCC]
   < 1-1A |R| 2-1A > =     -0.086485     -0.093700     -0.002599 [CCC]
   < 2-1A |R| 2-1A > =     -0.483777      0.174180      0.308239 [CCC]
converting the z component to Debye is TDM(Z)= -0.006606 and DM(Z)= 0.783471

the RHF-level $VEC1 required by for RUNTYP=TRANSITN jobs is not included.
