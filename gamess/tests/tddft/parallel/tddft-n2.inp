!  From these labels, we can deduce that states 1+2 are the a state,
!  that state 3 is the a' state, and states 4+5 are the w state.
!  Energies are overestimated by 0.8 eV or so, and there is a 
!  reversal of the two (admittedly very close) a and a' states.
!  The labels match the textbook exercise.

!  We can see that states 1+2 as well as state 3 are labeled correctly.
!  However, states 4+5 are wrong.  It is impossible for any degenerate
!  state to resolve to the same symbol twice, and the correct answer for
!  a delta-u state is B1u + B2u.
