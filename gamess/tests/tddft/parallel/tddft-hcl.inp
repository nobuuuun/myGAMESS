!   HCl test of convergence of TD-DFT w.r.t. basis set/radial grids
!
!   HCl's spectra is dominated by Rydberg states, arising from the
!   excitations (sig)2(pi4) -> (sig)2(pi)3(xx)1 where the orbital xx
!   is 4s, 4p, ...  There is only one valence state mixed in with 
!   the Rydberg states.  See

!   -------- results below by the older PCn and APCn bases ----------
!   Let us agree to keep the ground state grid at (125,1202) to be
!   sure that there is always the identical high quality S0 state.
!   We use the *long range correction* with the BLYP functional.
!
!   Jensen's PC2 basis is  Chlorine: 5s,3p,2d,1f  Hydrogen: 3s,2p,1d
!   his augmentation for anions= Cl: 6s,4p,3d,2f  Hydrogen: 4s,3p,2d
!   By roughly even-tempered extension, Rydberg functions are added
!   to the augmented APC2 set on the Cl atom only, in two sets:
!     1st + means s(0.020), p(0.010), d(0.020), f(0.025)
!     2nd + means s(0.007), p(0.003), d(0.004), f(0.005) added to 1st +
!
!   First, using 150 radial points and 1202 Lebedev points in the TDDFT,
!   we probe the basis set convergence.  
!   ground state is more or less converged from the start,
!      pc2:   FINAL R-BLYP ENERGY IS     -460.5944545781
!     apc2:   FINAL R-BLYP ENERGY IS     -460.5956120493 
!     apc2+:  FINAL R-BLYP ENERGY IS     -460.5956331393 
!     apc2++: FINAL R-BLYP ENERGY IS     -460.5956348188 
!   Rydberg states are sensitive to the quality of the diffuse AOs.
!   The first eight excited singlets are (degeneracy):
!      pc2:   7.657(2), 11.089(2), 11.997(1), 14.435(2), 14.602(?) eV
!     apc2:   7.417(2),  9.139(2),  9.549(2),  9.749(2)
!     apc2+:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)
!     apc2++: 7.416(2),  9.003(2),  9.405(2),  9.492(2)
!   The singly degenerate state at 12 eV in the small basis is the V
!   state, a valence sigma -> sigma*, which according to experiment
!   has a much longer R=2.512, and adiabatic Te=77,293 cm-1 = 9.58 eV.
!
!   Considering apc2+ to be converged with respect to basis set,
!   let's keep the angular grid at army grade quality 1202, and
!   vary the radial grid:     (TDDFT iters and total job timings)
!       150:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)   t= 816 of 849 total
!       125:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)   t= 714 of 747
!       100:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)   t= 558 of 590
!        75:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)   t= 437 of 470
!        50:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)   t= 301 of 333
!        25:  7.417(2),  9.011(2),  9.407(2),  9.495(2)   t= 171 of 204
!   According to Jarecki and Davidson, we should be able to obtain
!   the normalization integral of a GTO exponent of size 0.001 to
!   only about 4 digits (e.g. <s(0.001)|s(0.001)>=0.9998 using a
!   Bragg/Slater radius of unity) with a grid containing 50 points.
!
!   The apc2+ basis set contains an exponent of 0.01 and 50 radial
!   points are accurate enough.  Unfortunately the excited states
!   of HCl are not diffuse enough to let us test the apc2++'s GTO
!   exponents of approximately 0.002.
!
!   A grid of about 50 can handle exponents up to about 10,000 with
!   the same accuracy.  Since excitation of core electrons is very
!   high energy, this is probably not as big a concern as how small
!   of an exponent can be integrated accurately.  
!
!   It is easy to guess that we don't actually need the angular grid
!   of the excited state to be "army grade", so let's decrease that,
!   using 48 radial points (half of the default ground state grid):
!      1202:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t=290 of 323
!       434:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t=130 of 163
!       302:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t=102 of 135
!       194:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t= 81 of 112
!       170:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t= 76 of 108
!       146:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t= 71 of 103
!       110:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t= 63 of  96
!        86:  7.416(2),  9.009(2),  9.405(2),  9.494(2)  t= 58 of  91
!   Of course, this is a very round system, the total density of
!   the ground state of HCl must be much like Ar, although the
!   excited states are of doubly degenerate pi and delta symmetry.
