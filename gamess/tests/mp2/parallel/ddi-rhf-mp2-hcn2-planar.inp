!  using 6-31++G(d,p) has just 63 AOs.  This is "planar" isomer #2.
!
!  FINAL E(RHF)=-147.1813960582, 14 iters, E(MP2)= -147.6829919961
!  MP2 occupancies deviate from 2/0,
!  namely 1st order wfn's occupations are 1.8847 and 0.1053.
!  There are only very modest occ.no. below zero, none above two.

!  -----------------------------------------------------------------
!  This molecule's geometry will open the NCN angle if optimized
!  with a multireference wavefunction, increasing the NN distance.
!  But what if we did not know that, instead we just suspect that
!  this species might have multireference character?
!
!        the following results can be obtained at the RHF geometry,
!        as diagnostics of possible multireference character:
!
!  RHF tells us that e(HOMO)= -0.0626 and e(LUMO)=+0.1621 which are
!     close together (remember this is an anion, HOMO should be high)
!  MP2 natural orbital occupation no's are
!     3*2.0,..., 1.9523,1.9190,1.8847, 0.1053,0.0673,0.0296, ...,-0.0009
!     n(occ)=21.6195, n(vir)=0.3805  (last 5 occ.no.are very small negative)
!  CCSD prints that the T1 diagnostic is 0.02423957 (> Lee/Taylor's 0.02),
!     1.9806 1.9711 1.9665 1.9602 1.9527 1.9550 1.8902 1.9257 0.0000 0.0000
!     0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.1043 0.0002 0.0004 0.0002 0.0186 0.0004 0.0001
!     0.0714 0.0188 0.0145 0.0279 0.0271 0.0173 0.0101 0.0075 0.0006 0.0083

!     which sums to 15.60 e- in principal natural orbitals, 0.40 e- outside.
!     and one also gets individual T1 and T2 amplitudes to contemplate.
!  MCSCF full valence space (16e-, 13 orbitals) has active occ.no.
!     1.9964 1.9940 1.9842 1.9777 1.9765 1.9739 1.9369 1.8811
!     0.1254 0.0849 0.0275 0.0251 0.0163
!     which sums to 0.28 electrons outside RHF occupied orbitals.
!     If you take the trouble to read in natural orbitals, to get
!     the coefficient of the SCF determinant using the NOs,
!     then C0=0.9322794, meaning C0**2 = 86.9% of the wavefunction.
!
!  all results above at RHF geometry.
!
!  It is clear that there is an important a1 -> b1 double excitation,
!  for NN sigma to NN sigma* (canonical orbital 10 to 17 by CCSD's T2).
!  It is a little outside the range of a pi to pi* double, which
!  typically is about 0.10 e-, but only a little.  The T1 diagnostic
!  is a bit bigger than the threshold for concern, the relaxed density
!  of MP2 has some very tiny negative values, but all in all, the
!  indications of multireference character are modest.
!
!  It requires MCSCF geometry optimization to reveal the full extent
!  of this molecule's multireference character, the NN sigma* becomes
!  more and more important as rNN increases.
!
!      RHF geometry is rCN=1.274, rNN=1.818, rCH=1.098, aHCN=134.5
!      DFT geometry is rCN=1.310, rNN=1.939, rCH=1.112, aHCN=132.2 (revTPSS)
!      MP2 geometry is rCN=1.324, rNN=2.025, rCH=1.100, aHCN=130.1
!     CCSD geometry is rCN=1.308, rNN=1.966, rCH=1.103, aHCN=131.3
!  CCSD(T) geometry is rCN=1.320, rNN=2.057, rCH=1.107, aHCN=128.8
!    MCSCF geometry is rCN=1.323, rNN=2.082, rCH=1.130, aHCN=128.1
!
!  At its optimal geometry, MCSCF occupation numbers are
!    1.9958 1.9940 1.9827 1.9751 1.9742 1.9717 1.9252 1.7928
!    0.2160 0.0963 0.0312 0.0258 0.0193  (0.39 e- outside RHF)
!  and now we have an orbital occupancy falling below 1.8 e-.
!
!  Note that the single reference method's geometries track the MCSCF
!  in this case, since the multireference character is "modest".
!  This certainly isn't always the case!
