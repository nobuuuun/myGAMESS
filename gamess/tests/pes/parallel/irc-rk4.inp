!  NH3 pyramidalization, by the 4th order Runge-Kutta stepper
!     (see the similar AMPC4 test case for more details)
!
!  the RK4 stepper should yield this path information:
!     point 1, STOTAL= 0.17134, RHF E= -56.1650174004
!     point 2, STOTAL= 0.17756, RHF E= -56.1650274863
!     point 3, STOTAL= 0.18321, RHF E= -56.1650341539
!     point 4, STOTAL= 0.18942, RHF E= -56.1650414397
!  the predicted point 5 should be at S=0.196361, r(NH)=0.98711,
!  and ang(HNH)=119.56.  Its energy is not computed in this run.
!
!  This run takes 0 seconds on a 2.66 GHz Cloverton (30 Apr 2015)
!  results haven't changed significantly since 1999
