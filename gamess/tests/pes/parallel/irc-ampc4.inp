!  NH3 pyramidalization, by Adams-Moulton predictor corrector integrator.
!  the unpolarized basis 6-31G (unlike some s,p basis sets) has
!  a saddle point for planar ammonia, and we "react" from that
!  planar D3h saddle, towards the usual pyramidal ammonia.
!  Note the reaction path possesses C3v rather than D3h symmetry.
!
!  the 4th order AMPC stepper should yield this path information:
!     point 1, STOTAL= 0.17134, RHF E= -56.1650174004
!     point 2, STOTAL= 0.17756, RHF E= -56.1650274863
!     point 3, STOTAL= 0.17954, RHF E= -56.1650300241
!     point 4, STOTAL= 0.18201, RHF E= -56.1650323457
!  the predicted point 5 should be at S=0.187373, r(NH)=0.98716,
!  and ang(HNH)=119.60.  Its energy is not computed in this run.
!
!  It is clear that the step off the saddle point
!    INITIAL DISPLACEMENT= -0.17 ALONG MODE WITH FREQUENCY= 424.3i CM**-1
!  isn't well matched to the step size used after that.
!
!  This run takes 0 seconds on a 2.66 GHz Cloverton (29 Apr 2015)
!  results haven't changed significantly since 1999
